# Machine Learning: Identify Rock Papper Scissors Image
### Overview:
Developed a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow to classify images of hand gestures for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

### Key Steps:
- Data Augmentation: Enhanced the training dataset with techniques like rotation and flipping to improve model robustness.
- Model Evaluation: Achieved an accuracy of 92% on the test set.
- Visualization: Included confusion matrices to show classification accuracy across the three classes.

### Impact:
This project demonstrates practical applications of image recognition, which can be extended to more complex gesture-based interfaces.
